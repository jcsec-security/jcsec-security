### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“« **Looking for someone to audit your Smart Contract**? ðŸ“«
* Drop a line to **[@jcr_auditor](https://t.me/jcr_auditor)** in Telegram or email me at **jc@jcsec.io**  

I have been breaking things professionally since early 2016. My whole career has been focused on offensive security with a strong background doing pen-testing of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile, or cloud, but since 2021, I have been working full-time as a Smart Contract auditor.

In addition, I **lecture** on **Solidity/EVM security** to ðŸŒ±blockchain studentsðŸŒ± at some institutions and give workshops/talks on the topic occasionally.

Current expertise:
- CosmWasm smart contracts, Rust 
- Solidity/EVM
