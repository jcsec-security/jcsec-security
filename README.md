### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“« **Looking for someone to audit your Smart Contract**? ðŸ“«
* Drop a line to **[@jcr_auditor](https://t.me/jcr_auditor)** in Telegram or email me at **jc@jcsec.io**  

Breaking things professionally since early 2016. My whole career has been focused on offensive security and pentesting of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile, or cloud but since 2021 I have been working full-time as a Smart Contract auditor.

Since 2022 I have been **teaching** a couple of **Solidity/EVM** security courses of my creation to ðŸŒ±beginner blockchain developersðŸŒ±.

Current expertise:
- CosmWasm (Rust) [âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡]
- Solidity/EVM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[âš¡âš¡âš¡ ðŸª² ðŸª²]
