### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* Drop a line to **[@jcr_auditor](https://t.me/jcr_auditor)** in Telegram or email me at **jc@jcsec.io**  

Breaking things professionally since early 2016. My whole career has been focused on offensive security and pentesting of "traditional" stuff like web, mobile or cloud but since 2021 I have been working full-time as Smart Contract auditor. At the moment, my deepest expertise lies within **CosmWasm/Rust**.

Since 2022 I have been **teaching** a couple of **Solidity/EVM** security courses of my creation to ðŸŒ±beginner blockchain developersðŸŒ±

Current expertise:
- CosmWasm (Rust) âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡âš¡
- Solidity/EVM    âš¡âš¡âš¡
- NEAR (Rust)     âš¡
